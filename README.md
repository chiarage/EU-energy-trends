# EU-energy-trends
A Data Visualization Project built with Looker Studio, analyzing how EU policies shaped CO₂ emissions, renewable energy growth, and sustainable investments between 2010 and 2020.

## File Structure
### Dashboard
- Looker Studio Dashbord -> interactive visualizations of EU energy trends and investments from 2010 to 2020
https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/edc31d7a-8afa-4048-be84-9c40fdcaf7dd?s=p4w8uzwdh2A
- EU Energy Trends Report -> a report analyzing how EU policies influenced CO₂ emissions, renewable energy growth, and sustainable investments from 2010 to 2020, highlighting key trends and insights.

### Datasets
1. Sustainable Energy Investment Forecast Dataset
  - Source: Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zelihayb/sustainable-energy-investment-forecast-dataset/data
  - Description: Contains key indicators for sustainable energy and environmental analysis, including per capita CO₂ emissions, energy consumption, reliance on energy sources (coal, hydro, natural gas, nuclear, oil, renewables), renewable electricity production, energy efficiency, total energy use, and demographic/spatial data (population density, total population, land area).
  - Scope in this project: Only EU member countries from 2010 to 2020.

2. Invested in Renewables – The Only Way Forward
  - Source: European Investment Bank https://www.eib.org/en/essays/europe-energy-transition-renewable
  - Description: Provides two datasets:
  -   Investment in the energy transition ($ billion), by region: Covers renewable energy, energy storage, power networks, electrified transport, clean shipping and industry, carbon capture, hydrogen, and nuclear energy.
  -   Investment in renewable energy ($ billion), by region: Covers solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other renewable sources.
  - Scope in this project: Investments from 2014 to 2023. Investments between 2010–2014 are not reported due to lack of data.
